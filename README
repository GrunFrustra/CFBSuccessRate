-Data now prints to a directory.  A File stores each individual team's success rate data.
-Current bug with the logic, need to run through more unit tests to find out reasons some success outputs is wrong.
-Still testing edge cases, running  through multiple game's play-by-play data, and catching bugs as they occur.

Note:Initially, play-by-play data is obtained by manually copying and pasting ncaa.com play-by-play recaps into a text file that is 
overwritten for each game.  Eventually the goal is to have a more complex scraper built that automatically collects this data without a 
copy/paste, but a url.  Since I want to complete something usuable
before the start of the season, this is the fastest result I could think of without requiring more research.
I'm still not adept on web scraping, so a clean cut and paste of a data produced easier to parse info than page sources for game recaps.

Objective: 
*Analyze success rate of a team on 1st down, 2nd down, 3rd down, and 4th down.  
*Total success rate can be calculated as well with these values.
*Using the metrics of a successful play by Bill Connelly

A first down success is when a team gains at least 50% of yards needed to get 1st down.
A second down success is when a team gains at least 70% of yards needed to get 1st down.
A third and fourth down success is when a team gains all the yards needed to get a 1st down.
